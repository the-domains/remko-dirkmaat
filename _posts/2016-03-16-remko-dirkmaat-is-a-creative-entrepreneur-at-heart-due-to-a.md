Remko Dirkmaat is a Creative Entrepreneur at heart. Due to a passion for everything that is on the intersection of Concepts, Startups, Design, Technology and Food, he loves helping others to realize their dreams.   
He is therefor the Creative Director at Codeless Technology - a software development company that has created the 'Smart Software Cloning' Concept -, as well as CO-Founder of [Instagreen.eu][0], a company that grows vegetables locally in a beautiful designed incubator.

At age 21, while doing a Architectural Engineering Master study at the Technical University of Delft, he started his first professional venture _SuperNova Studio's -- architecture, concept development and visualization _with four other students.

At age 26 he started EQUINOX -- architecture & visualization, only to notice some time later, after moving to Barcelona, that his passion is not with architecture but with the creative processes of converting ideas or concepts into a product or service, and the branding, presentation and marketing of those products and services.

After surviving a non-opening-parachute accident he promised himself 2 things:

**1) Make his stay on earth worthwhile, by helping his and the dreams of others come true.****2) Enjoy life to the fullest**.

Hence his motto:_Pushing Dreams towards Reality. _So he started to concentrate on doing the things he likes most: help with starting up initiatives (as a profession) and food/cooking (as a hobby).

Startups and Cooking. Two different worlds that seem to be miles apart, but they are incredibly alike in key-aspects: it takes practice, knowledge and some guts to work on. Don't be afraid of failure, as it is a good way to learn. Taste and try often to see if your cooking or business-processes are going according to plan or if they need more or other ingredients to meet your expectations. Don't be afraid to improvise or ask more experienced people for advice. And most important: both a good diner and a startup are worthless if you don't enjoy them in the company of the right people.

This is the chapter where his life is at this moment: working as a Creative Director at Codeless, working on startups like [Instagreen.eu][0] and helping other initiatives.

> Life is a constant process of learning and getting better. So even though some (or most) initiatives fail in an early stage, failing is considered part of practice. As Bruce Lee said: _"I fear not the man who has practiced a 1000 kicks. I fear the man that practiced 1 kick a 1000 times."_

Oh, and by the way: you can still find him hanging under a parachute regularly.
